\caption{
Resource sharing rates across donor-recipient relationships.
Neighbor describes any potential recipient cell.
Related neighbor describes a recipient cell that is a direct cellular progenitor or offspring of the donor, registered to a same signaling channel as the donor, or a member of a signaling channel that is a progenitor or offspring of the donor's.
Unrelated neighbors constitutes all neighbors that are not related neighbors.
Channelmate refers to donor-recipient pairs that are registered to a same signaling channel.
Note that level-one groups are not defined in the flat treatment.
Non-channelmate recipients are not registered to any same signaling channel in common with the potential donor.
Cell child and parent describe direct nuclear cell relationships between donor and recipient.
Finally, a propagule child relationship exists when a donor cell is a member of the highest-level signaling channel that directly begat the recipient's.
A propagule parent relationship describes the converse.
Error bars indicate 95\% confidence.
