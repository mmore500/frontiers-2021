Resource sharing to mutually exclusive sub-categories of hereditary group comrades: cellular child, cellular parent, and neither (``non-nuclear'').
Resource sharing to entirely non-related cells (no cell, hereditary group, or propagule relation) is included for comparison.
Note that L1 hereditary groups are not defined in either of the flat treatments.
Error bars indicate 95\% confidence.
