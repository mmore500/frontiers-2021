\caption{
Resource sharing to mutually exclusive sub-categories same-channel cellular neighbors: cellular child, cellular parent, and neither (``non-nuclear'').
Resource sharing to entirely non-related cells (no cell, channel, or propagule relation) is included for comparison.
Note that level-one groups are not defined in either of the flat treatments.
Error bars indicate 95\% confidence.
