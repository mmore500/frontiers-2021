  abstract = 	 {Neural networks have proven effective at solving difficult problems but designing their architectures can be challenging, even for image classification problems alone. Our goal is to minimize human participation, so we employ evolutionary algorithms to discover such networks automatically. Despite significant computational requirements, we show that it is now possible to evolve models with accuracies within the range of those published in the last year. Specifically, we employ simple evolutionary techniques at unprecedented scales to discover models for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, starting from trivial initial conditions and reaching accuracies of 94.6\% (95.6\% for ensemble) and 77.0\%, respectively. To do this, we use novel and intuitive mutation operators that navigate large search spaces; we stress that no human participation is required once evolution starts and that the output is a fully-trained model. Throughout this work, we place special emphasis on the repeatability of results, the variability in the outcomes and the computational requirements.}

  abstract = {We present SignalGP, a new genetic programming (GP) technique designed to incorporate the event-driven programming paradigm into computational evolution's toolbox. Event-driven programming is a software design philosophy that simplifies the development of reactive programs by automatically triggering program modules (event-handlers) in response to external events, such as signals from the environment or messages from other programs. SignalGP incorporates these concepts by extending existing tag-based referencing techniques into an event-driven context. Both events and functions are labeled with evolvable tags; when an event occurs, the function with the closest matching tag is triggered. In this work, we apply SignalGP in the context of linear GP. We demonstrate the value of the event-driven paradigm using two distinct test problems (an environment coordination problem and a distributed leader election problem) by comparing SignalGP to variants that are otherwise identical, but must actively use sensors to process events or messages. In each of these problems, rapid interaction with the environment or other agents is critical for maximizing fitness. We also discuss ways in which SignalGP can be generalized beyond our linear GP implementation.},

Using settling selection, multicellularity evolved quickly and repeatedly from a common unicellular ancestor, Baker's yeast. The transition occurred by persistent adhesion of daughter cells following cell replication. The resulting multicellular individuals had a morphology reminiscent of snowflakes, with many characteristics of extant multicellular species, including cell–cell attachment, a single-cell bottleneck, and juvenile and adult life history stages. Cellular division of labor by apoptosis evolved in large snowflake clusters, ameliorating the effects of a trade-off between snowflake settling and growth rate. Continued settling selection led to additional adaptation, such as a more hydrodynamic cluster shape. The majority of the developmental changes that evolved after the transition to multicellularity were contingent on this transition and even on the specific mode of cluster formation. The origin and subsequent evolution of multicellular complexity in snowflake yeast can be directly attributed to natural selection.}",

abstract = {Abstract Cooperation is a classic solution to hostile environments that limit individual survival. In extreme cases this may lead to the evolution of new types of biological individuals (e.g., eusocial super-organisms). We examined the potential for interindividual cooperation to evolve via experimental evolution, challenging nascent multicellular “snowflake yeast” with an environment in which solitary multicellular clusters experienced low survival. In response, snowflake yeast evolved to form cooperative groups composed of thousands of multicellular clusters that typically survive selection. Group formation occurred through the creation of protein aggregates, only arising in strains with high (>2\%) rates of cell death. Nonetheless, it was adaptive and repeatable, although ultimately evolutionarily unstable. Extracellular protein aggregates act as a common good, as they can be exploited by cheats that do not contribute to aggregate production. These results highlight the importance of group formation as a mechanism for surviving environmental stress, and underscore the remarkable ease with which even simple multicellular entities may evolve—and lose—novel social traits.},

abstract="An evolutionary transition in individuality (ETI) is a fundamental shift in the unit of adaptation. ETIs occur through the evolution of groups of individuals into a new higher-level individual. The evolution of groups with cells specialized in somatic (viability) or reproductive functions has been proposed as a landmark of the unicellular to multicellular ETI. Several recent models of the evolution of multicellularity and cellular specialization have contributed insights on different aspects of this topic; however, these works are disconnected from each other and from the general framework of ETIs. While each of these works is valuable on its own, our interest in ETIs motivates an attempt to connect these models. We review the theory of ETIs along with these recent models with an eye towards better integrating insights from these models into the ETI framework. We consider how each model addresses key recurring topics, such as the importance of cooperation and conflict, life history trade-offs, multi-level selection, division of labor and the decoupling of fitness at the level of the group from the level of the cell. Finally, we identify a few areas in which conflicting views or unanswered questions remain, and we discuss modeling strategies that would be most suited for making further progress in understanding ETIs.",

abstract = {Developing software to effectively take advantage of growth in parallel and distributed
processing capacity poses significant challenges. Traditional programming techniques
allow a user to assume that execution, message passing, and memory are always kept
synchronized. However, maintaining this consistency becomes increasingly costly at
scale. One proposed strategy is "best-effort computing", which relaxes synchronization
and hardware reliability requirements, accepting nondeterminism in exchange for efficiency.
Although many programming languages and frameworks aim to facilitate software development
for high performance applications, existing tools do not directly provide a prepackaged
best-effort interface. The Conduit C++ Library aims to provide such an interface for
convenient implementation of software that uses best-effort inter-thread and inter-process
communication. Here, we describe the motivation, objectives, design, and implementation
of the library. Benchmarks on a communication-intensive graph coloring problem and
a compute-intensive digital evolution simulation show that Conduit's best-effort model
can improve scaling efficiency and solution quality, particularly in a distributed,
multi-node context.},
